# Bin-Problem
This repository includes the examples and methods that can be used to solve Bin problems.
One of the common challenges in businesses is how to optimally place a set of items within a limited space. For instance, in logistics, the goal might be to determine the minimum number of containers required to transport goods from one location to another. Similarly, in technology, the aim could be to allocate tasks across several servers in a way that achieves load balancing.
In such problems, the objective function is typically minimizing the number of containers used.
The key constraints in these problems include:
·      Placement of all items: Ensuring that all requested items are placed in the containers.
·      Container capacity: Ensuring that the total items allocated to a container do not exceed its capacity.
·      Container activation: A container is activated only if at least one item is assigned to it.
The mathematical model for the 3D Bin Packing Problem is illustrated in the figure below. Additionally, the implementation of this mathematical model using the Docplex library in Python is provided, which allows for easy application in optimization problems.
